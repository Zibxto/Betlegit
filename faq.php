                                    <h4>What does (Low, Normal, High) before tips  mean?</h4>
                                    <p>The (Low,Normal, High) before the tip suggests the confidence in the tip.  ‘High’ number stands for higher confidence in the tip, Normal stands for standard Probability, Why low stands for lower rate most of the time. The chance is followed by the tip on the match winner. Thus “High on Arsenal” means that Arsenal will most likely win the match.</p>

                                    <p>It is about betting on both teams to score, ‘Yes means both the home and away team will score’, While  ‘No mean either Home or Away team will not score or both  won’t score.</p>

                                    <h4>What does it mean Score?</h4>
                                    <p>It is about betting on final Score/goals to be scored. Also determining Under/Over can be derived. Under means that less than 3 goals will be scored during the match(0:0, 1:0, 0:1, 2:0, 0:2 nebo 1:1), over, on the other hand is a betting on more than two goals will be scored during the match.</p>

                                    <h4>What bankroll is enough?</h4>
                                    <p>Cautious better should stick to “bankroll management”. Personally I do not recommend using more than 5% of your betting budget. So, if you have reserved $500 for betting, do not spend more than $25 for each match. Most of on line bookmakers enable bets of only $10.</p>
